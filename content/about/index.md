Hi, I'm Ken Nichol. I'm a technical consultant and WordPress engineer based in British Columbia, Canada, with a growing focus on cloud infrastructure, static site architecture, and the principles of sustainable software development.

I've spent the last decade helping organizations-from startups to larger businesses-get the most out of the web. Whether it's modernizing aging CMS stacks, smoothing out deployment workflows, building performant and maintainable websites that load *fast* and scale *cleanly*, or debugging hard to fix bugs, I love digging into the systems underneath the pixels.

Recently, I've been rebuilding my digital presence with Hugo and Netlify: rethinking how I document, share, and work in the open. I believe in simplicity, transparency, and crafting with care-whether it's a client-facing site or a bash script that logs my day.

Outside of code, I am organizing my thoughts in Markdown, exploring automation tools, and diving into platform design ideas that make developing easier and more efficient.

I am a proud **mentor with [Zero To Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io)**, where I help guide developers through their challenges in course work, portfolio development, and the nuances of growing as a modern developer. You can find me contributing to the [ZTM GitHub Community](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery) as well: especially during Hacktoberfest.
